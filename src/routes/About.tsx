const FAQ = [
  {
    q: 'Who runs this?',
    a: 'Students. It started as a folder of scanned notes shared in a class group and turned into a site because nobody could ever find the right link twice. It isn’t run by the school and it isn’t official.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is it free? Will it stay free?',
    a: 'Yes and yes. There are no ads, no accounts and nothing to sign up for. It’s a handful of static files on GitHub Pages, which costs nothing to host.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Whose notes are these?',
    a: 'They belong to the students who wrote them, and every file credits its author by name. If you wrote something here and want it taken down, email and it goes down — no argument.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How do I add my notes?',
    a: 'Email them. There’s no upload form on purpose — every file is looked at by a person before it goes up, so juniors can trust what they find here. Scans are fine as long as the writing is readable. Put your name on it; credit is the whole point.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I trust these for the boards?',
    a: 'Treat them as a head start, not a source of truth. They’re student notes: fast to revise from, occasionally wrong. Anything that decides a mark should be checked against the NCERT book or the CBSE syllabus.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Are the NCERT chapters hosted here?',
    a: 'No. Those open straight from ncert.nic.in, where they’re published free. This site is only a faster index into them — nothing is copied or re-uploaded. Same for the outside links and channels.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does it track me?',
    a: 'There’s basic page-view analytics and nothing else. Saved files, your timings and your marks stay in your own browser — none of it is sent anywhere.',

            The first version of this site was seven pages of hand-written HTML and it took six
            clicks to reach a PDF. It worked, in the sense that the files were technically on the
            internet.

            This version starts from the question that actually matters at 11pm the night before a
            paper: <em>how fast can someone get from “I need the chem notes” to reading them?</em>{' '}
            Search is the front door. Everything else — every NCERT chapter, the calculators, the
            bell timings, the channels — is here because students were opening a different tab for
            it anyway.

            Almost nothing here is hosted by us — it points at material that was already free
            and just badly signposted. The one part that has to be built from scratch is the
            handwritten notes library, and that only grows when people send things in.
