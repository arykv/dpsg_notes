# All Nighter — handover

Everything a new session needs to pick this up. Rewritten 30 July 2026, after
the build that took the site from 10 routes to 30.

> **Read `VISION.md` first.** This file is the *state*. That one is the *why* —
> the positioning, the things we deliberately don't build, and the decisions that
> were reversed and why. When they conflict, `VISION.md` is authoritative.

## 1. The essentials

| | |
|---|---|
| Live | <https://allnighter.in> |
| Repo | `github.com/arykv/allnighter` (renamed from `dpsg_notes` 28 Jul 2026; old URLs redirect) |
| Local | `~/Documents/dpsg-notes` — note the directory name never changed |
| Hosting | Vercel, project `allnighter` under `arykvs-projects`, auto-deploys from `main` |
| Old domain | `dps-gandhinagar.in` — GitHub Pages, orphan `legacy-domain` branch, one `noindex` page. See §7 |
| Build | `tsc --noEmit && vite build && vite build --ssr … && node scripts/prerender.mjs` |
| Output | 30 prerendered routes, ~11 MB (5.5 MB of that is answer-script images) |

**Deploy = push to `main`.** He checks the live site, so deploy after each
meaningful change.

## 2. Who it's for and by

**Aryan Rao Kaveti**, Class of 2026, DPS Gandhinagar (Ambapur).

**Born 03/04/2009 — 17 until April 2027.** This blocks every Indian payment
gateway (18+ with PAN) *and* Amazon Associates. Don't plan revenue features
around him signing up for anything.

### His results — verified against the real marksheets

**Class 12, 2026 — 92.8%**

| Subject | Theory | Prac/IA | Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| Computer Science | 68 | 30 | 98 |
| English Core | 76 | 20 | 96 |
| Mathematics | 71 | 20 | 91 |
| Physics | 60 | 30 | 90 |
| Chemistry | 59 | 30 | 89 |

**Class 10, 2024 — 95.2%** (best of five, Hindi dropped)
Computer Applications 98 · Social Science 96 · Science 95 · Maths 94 ·
English 93 · Hindi 89

Note: Maths and English theory are out of **80**; Physics, Chemistry and CS out
of **70**. Practicals differ accordingly.

### The moderation evidence — the project's whole foundation

His evaluated answer scripts (OSM) versus the marksheet:

| Subject | Script | Marksheet | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| Chemistry | **52** | 59 | **+7** |
| Physics | **58** | 60 | **+2** |
| Mathematics | 71 | 71 | 0 |
| Computer Science | 68 | 68 | 0 |
| English Core | 76 | 76 | 0 |

Three exact matches prove the script's "Total Marks" field really *is* the
marksheet's theory column — which is what makes the other two readable.
**+9 marks total: 91.0% → 92.8%.**

**A second finding, from adding the question-wise marks up by hand.** On four of
five scripts the individual marks sum exactly to the printed total. Chemistry
sums to **51.5** and prints **52**. Chemistry is also the only paper with an
*odd* number of half-marks (11, against Physics 10, English 4, Maths 2, CS 0) —
so a fractional total is rounded up *before* moderation. Chemistry's real
journey is **51.5 → 52 → 59**.

Half-mark counts per script are in `src/data/results.ts` (`HALF_MARKS`).

## 3. Hard constraints

### Privacy — never publish

- Roll numbers: `11611774` (Class 12), `11112965` (Class 10)
- Parents' names: Indu Rao Kaveti, Kaveti Laxminarayana Rao
- Date of birth: 03/04/2009

Marksheets are **rebuilt as components** from the numbers, never screenshotted —
see `src/components/Marksheet.tsx`, which names the withheld fields on the page
because saying so *is* the trust signal.

The answer scripts are different: they contain none of the above. CBSE's own
instructions forbid writing your name, roll number or school in an answer, which
is why publishing them was possible at all. See §6.

### Design — he rejected the first attempt as "looks AI generated"

That version was near-black canvas, one mint accent, a radial glow blob and a
faint grid. **Do not drift back toward it.** The approved direction is an Indian
school register:

- Bottle-green *ground* (not black); warm paper in light mode
- Faint horizontal ruling on a 30px rhythm across the whole page
- One red margin line down the left of the content column (`.register`)
- Marigold is the marking colour — used only for what is live *now*
- Type: Bricolage Grotesque (display) / Archivo (UI) / Azeret Mono (data)
- Light = notebook page. Dark = register cover.

Tokens live in `src/index.css`. Motion vocabulary in `src/lib/motion.ts` — two
springs (`snap`, `settle`) and one ease. Use them; don't hand-roll.

### Standing product rules

- **No uploads, no database.** He killed a scoped Supabase flow. Contributions
  come by email to `dpsgnotes@gmail.com`. *(This is what blocks deadline-alert
  emails — see §8.)*
- **No AI chatbot, no AI evaluator.** Reasoning in `VISION.md` §5.
- **Links, not re-hosting**, for NCERT and outside material.
- **Nothing gets paywalled.** Money only ever comes from printed objects.
- **No affiliate links, ever.** `/books` says so on the page.

## 4. What's built — all 30 routes

**The flagship**
- `/tonight` — *Pull an all nighter.* Three taps (subject chip, datetime,
  preparation), then an honest verdict and an hour-by-hour plan. Logic in
  `src/lib/allnighter.ts`; ranks units by **marks per minute**, names what it's
  dropping, and tells you to sleep with a number.

**The moat — unclonable, and the reason to trust everything else**
- `/results` — both marksheets as components, plus the moderation receipt
- `/paper` — what happens to your paper after you hand it in
- `/paper/script/:slug` — **all five scripts, 183 pages**: `computer-science`,
  `physics`, `chemistry`, `mathematics`, `english`

**Curation**
- `/guide` + `/guide/class-12-{physics,chemistry,maths,english,computer-science}`
- `/books` — three books worth buying, and Maths where you should buy nothing

**Off-screen**
- `/print` + `/print/{physics-formulae,maths-formulae,organic-conversions,for-parents}`

**Utility (pre-existing)**
- `/` `/library` `/library/:id` `/chapters/class-{10,11,12}` `/tools` (7
  calculators) `/strategy` `/resources` `/day` `/about`

## 5. Architecture

```

  entry-server.tsx
scripts/
  prerender.mjs     renders routes → HTML, sitemap, JSON-LD, OG cards
  og.mjs            per-page Open Graph card generation
  og-assets/        pinned static fonts + glyph metrics + OFL licences
  redact.py         answer-script redaction, self-verifying
  build-ncert.py    regenerates ncert.json from ncert.nic.in
```

**Three build-time assertions guard the data.** They fail the build rather than
publish something wrong, and that's deliberate:

1. `guides.ts` — unit weightage must sum to the paper total (70/70/80/80/70).
   Coaching sites copy each other's typos and students plan their week on it.
2. `script.ts` — page numbers must be contiguous `1..n`, so captions can't drift
   out of step with the images and mislabel someone's evidence.
3. `og.mjs` — `measure()` throws on any character outside the font subset. An
   overflowing headline is invisible until someone shares it.

---

## 6. The answer scripts — how they're made

`scripts/redact.py <pdf> <outdir> <slug>` renders a script to web images and then
tries to break its own output.

**Three things are covered, nothing else:** the page-1 barcode (located by text
search, so the box is exact), the cover's office-use block (QR + IDEN/BAG/CHK),
and the scanning centre's small blue stamp on every page. All three identify the
*script*, not the candidate. Handwriting, marks, ticks, crosses and corrections
are untouched — covering those would defeat the purpose.

**The stamp filter is built from measured geometry**, not guesses: 31 correctly
detected CS stamps gave width 33–38px at 1700px, aspect 1.06–1.29, fill
0.80–0.93. The tolerances are those ranges with room either side.

**Expect exactly one box per page, except:**
- pages 3 and 4 — printed preliminaries, no stamp
- Maths pages 22–25 — bound-in graph sheets carry no stamp

Anything else means the filter needs re-checking for that subject.

### Source PDFs — in `~/Downloads`, deliberately not in git

| Subject | File | Pages |
|---|---|---|
| Computer Science | `5CB3A505-527F-49BA-B866-87C1B07A0241-2.pdf` | 35 |
| Physics | `1E6C7DA5-BF1C-49F3-99B0-637F5231BEAF.pdf` | 35 |
| Chemistry | `0DF9A2C7-1765-4F8A-BC96-70A5D5C59566.pdf` | 35 |
| Mathematics | `1D11A343-8B06-45AB-94B1-FF70D3FC6C0E.pdf` | 43 |
| English Core | `A8C772D1-B5C5-41D9-8237-9F21ACA3BAAB-2.pdf` | 35 |

Page 1 of each is real text — `page.get_text()` reads the marks summary straight
out.

### The rule that matters most

**Every page of every script was looked at individually before publishing, and
any new script must be too.** This is not a formality. It caught three separate
problems that the automated verifier passed clean:

1. The first CS run boxed **three chunks of a real answer** (blue ballpoint read
   as a stamp). Fixed by confining detection to the header band.
2. The CS-era filter matched **up to twelve of Physics's blue mark chips per
   page** — it would have blacked out the very marks the script exists to show.
   Fixed by the measured geometry above.
3. English's scans are skewed enough to put the stamp at y≈0.21, outside the
   0.20 band, so two pages shipped with it intact. Band widened to 0.27.

The verifier passed all three times. Looking at the pages is what caught them.

## 7. Technical gotchas — all learned the hard way

1. **Truncated PDF downloads still start with `%PDF`.** The NCERT builder must
   check for a trailing `%%EOF` and retry, or text extraction silently produces
   garbage titles.
2. **`AnimatePresence mode="wait"` with `Suspense` nested inside causes blank
   pages.** `Suspense` must wrap `AnimatePresence`, not the reverse. There's also
   a `RouteErrorBoundary`.
3. **Vite copies `public/` into every build target.** The SSR build sets
   `copyPublicDir: false` or it duplicates the whole assets folder.
4. **`renderToString` cannot await Suspense.** `entry-server.tsx` renders up to 4
   passes, checking for the skeleton, so lazy routes resolve.
5. **Radix Accordion content needs `forceMount`** or collapsed chapters are
   invisible to crawlers.
6. **Prerendered routes must exist as `dist/<route>/index.html`.** Vercel checks
   the filesystem before rewrites, so the SPA fallback only catches unprerendered
   paths.
7. **`build-ncert.py` shells out to `curl`** — this machine sits behind a
   TLS-intercepting proxy Python's cert store doesn't trust.
8. **The GitHub Pages API does not rebuild when you change the source branch.**
   `gh api -X POST repos/<owner>/<repo>/pages/builds` after any change, or the
   old deployment keeps serving. This cost real time.
9. **Polling a URL for `200` proves nothing on this site.** The SPA fallback
   returns 200 for everything. Check `content_type` or grep for expected text.
10. **OG fonts are pinned static instances**, renamed to unique families
    (`OGDisplay`, `OGSans`…) so resvg can't pick the wrong weight, and subset to
    Latin. Regenerate with `fonttools` if the type ever changes.

`dps-gandhinagar.in` was **not** merely stale — GitHub Pages was serving a stuck
deployment of the *whole site*, 404ing on every route added after it and
competing with allnighter.in for identical content. It now publishes the orphan
`legacy-domain` branch: one `noindex, follow` page, `404.html` so old deep links
land somewhere human. Edit by pushing to that branch. **Don't merge `main` into
it and don't delete its `CNAME`.**

---

## 8. What's left — three things, none of them code

1. **Google Search Console.** Never done, for either domain. Deferred by Aryan
   until the site was content-complete — it now is. Needs his Google login and a
   TXT record at the registrar. Steps: add a **Domain** property for
   `allnighter.in` (not URL-prefix), verify by TXT, submit `sitemap.xml`, then
   request indexing for `/`, `/tonight`, `/results` and `/paper` by hand.
   **Do not add `dps-gandhinagar.in` as a property** — it's deliberately
   `noindex`; adding it to get it indexed would undo the fix.

2. **Deadline-alert emails — a decision, not a task.** "Tell me when the OSM
   window opens / the date sheet drops" is the one email a CBSE student genuinely
   wants, it's time-critical, and it recurs annually. But it needs an email
   backend, and *no uploads, no database* is a standing rule. **Decide the rule
   before building the feature.**

3. **Printed kits / pre-orders.** Blocked until April 2027 (age). The wall charts
   at `/print` double as the demand test in the meantime.

**Distribution, which is his to do:** a post on r/CBSE — *"I bought my evaluated
answer sheets back and compared them to my marksheet."* Genuine contribution,
nobody else has both documents, and it has to come from him to be honest.

---

## 9. Verified YouTube channels — check before changing

**An HTTP 200 plus a plausible `og:title` is not verification.** Several dead
accounts carry exactly the expected name. Check the page for
`"doesn't have any content"`, and prefer asking Aryan.

## 10. Working style

He moves fast, sends corrections mid-turn, and expects things built rather than
discussed. He catches wrong details and calls them out — verify before shipping,
especially anything with a name or a URL attached.

**Once he defers something, it's decided.** Record it once in the docs and stop
mentioning it. Closing four consecutive reports with "still on you: Search
Console" got exactly the response it deserved.

**He is usually right when he pushes back.** Two of the best decisions on this
project were his reversals of positions I'd argued for:

- Publishing the answer scripts. Both of us had said keep them private; his
  counter — *"otherwise how will students trust me"* — is correct, because
  evidence nobody can look at isn't evidence.
- Not selling them either. The analysis was always the product.

**Don't report after every small step when he's asked you to just finish.**

---

## 11. Archived / dormant

- **Uday's 8 handwritten PDFs** are in `archive/notes/`, off the site. Restoring
  one = move the PDF to `public/notes/` and paste its entry into `resources.ts`.
  When notes return they should get the HTML wrapper pattern in `VISION.md` §6 —
  summary, topics, quick nav, download — with the handwriting as primary content.
- **The old hand-written HTML site** is in `legacy/`, kept for history only and
  excluded from deployment via `.vercelignore`.
